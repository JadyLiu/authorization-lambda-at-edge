"content":"This content can only be seen after proper authentication via Lambda@Edge.  Your JWT token was passed in the Authorization http request header enabling authorization process to take place.  Lambda@Edge extracted the Authorization header, then performed a series of steps to validate the JWT token.  That included matching it up against User Pool ID as well as cryptographic verification of JWT signature.  Amazon cognito used a private RSA key and HMAC algorithm to create the JWT token signature.  Lambda@Edge used the public RSA key to decrypt the JWT signature and verify its validity.  If JWT signature is missing, or is expired or its signature does not pass validation tests, then Lambda@Edge returns 401 unauthorized error. For unauthorized requests, the function takes advantage of Lambda@Edge response-generating capabilities to send immediate response without causing any load on the origin server.  For authorized requests, the function takes advantage of Lamba@Edge capability to manipulate headers sent to origin.  In this case, the function removes Authorization header which cannot be handled by Amazon S3 as origin.  After Lambda@Edge is finished with header manipulation, CloudFront processes requests and responses according to the distribution configuration."
